# **Gaba**
Our solution to identifying mental health challenges is **Gaba** <br>
Gaba is a daily calendar-planner and journal app to help people record what they have done throughout the day. Gaba helps you identify the frequency of your habits, with its heat-mapping function, so that you can have control, and you can know when bad habits are getting out of control. At the same time, looking back on your heatmap can encourage people to form good habits. 

## Features

| Main Features | Description | Preview |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Journal** | The Journal-cum-to-do-list helps users to plan and stay on track with their day. Monitoring and recording what they do on a daily basis in this journal, aside from the benefit of being more in control of their lives, produces two outcomes. These are the collectible images and storing the data in the calendar. | ![ezgif com-optimize (5)](link to video) |
| **Collections** | After each entry Gaba uses AI to produce an image that is personal to what they did that day. This image is then stored in the user's collections page, and serve as a quick summary of all their entries. | ![ezgif com-optimize (6)](link to video) |
| **Calendar**  | Data from each journal entry is then collected and stored in the calendar to generate a heatmap of how often the user has been participating in certain habits, where users can monitor the frequency they partake in their habits. | ![ezgif com-optimize (4)](link to video) |
| **Reminder**  | Finally, if users are detected to regularly be participating in habits associated with people suffering from mental illness, Gaba will suggest for them to adopt healthier living patterns such as sleeping earlier | ![ezgif com-optimize (4)](link to video) |
